    <string name="hzd_description">Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view.
        Players take control of Aloy, a hunter who ventures through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures.
        Aloy can kill enemies in a variety of ways â€“ setting traps such as tripwires using the Tripcaster,
        shooting them with arrows, using explosives, and a spear. Aloy wears a Focus, a small head piece that scans
        machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their location, their level, and the nature of loot
        they will drop. Unless hacked with the Override Tool, or sufficiently hit with corruption arrows,
        machines do not exert aggressive force against each other. Aloy also engages in battle with human enemies,
        such as bandits and the Eclipse cult. </string>
